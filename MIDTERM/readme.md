# Midterm Project
### Animated personal logo.


In this project I will create an animated and interactive version of my personal logo. The program will start all in black and then white dots will start appearing reveling then my logo. 

To fix: I would like it to start in a white screen and have dots apprear and create my logo.

Code Plan

# Input

-	Moving the mouse across the image.
-	mousePressed to change color.
-	mouseReleased to go back to black.

# Pseudocode

-	Create black canvas.
-	Random white dots across the screen.
-	Draw letters in black on top of dots so they are not covered by the dots.
-	Measure the distance from the mouse and reveal the matrix underneath.
-	Press mouse to change color to gray, use an ‘if statement’, if the mouse is pressed the value will equal 100.
-	Also create an ‘if statement’ for when the mouse is released. If the value equals 100, then value will be 0.
